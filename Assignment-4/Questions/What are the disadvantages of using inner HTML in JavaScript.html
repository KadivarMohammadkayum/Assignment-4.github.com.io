    <!-- What are the disadvantages of using inner HTML in JavaScript? -->

    <!-- It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content again so that's why it takes time. When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML. -->
