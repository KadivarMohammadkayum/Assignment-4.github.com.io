    <!-- What are undeclared and undefined variales? -->

    <!-- Undeclared variables are those that have not been declared or defined in the current scope, while undefined variables are those that have been declared but not given a value.
    
    For example:

    Undefined: 

    let geek;
    undefined
    console.log(geek) 
    Undeclared: 

    ReferenceError: myVariable is not defined
    console.log(myVariable)
